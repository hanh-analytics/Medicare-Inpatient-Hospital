    "# **Analyzing the Impact of Policy Changes on Medicare Inpatient Hospital Program Payments Using T-Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to assess whether a significant difference exists in Medicare inpatient hospital program payments before and after a policy change in 2019. Using historical data from 2015 to 2021, we perform an **independent t-test** to compare the total program payments across these two periods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-Policy Period:** 2015–2018  \n",
    "2. **Post-Policy Period:** 2019–2021  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the validity of the t-test, we first conduct a **Shapiro-Wilk normality test** on both periods' data to check for normal distribution. Then, we apply a **Welch’s t-test** (assuming unequal variances) to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in program payments before and after the policy change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- If the **p-value < 0.05**, we conclude that there is a significant difference in program payments between the two periods, suggesting that the policy change had an impact.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- If the **p-value ≥ 0.05**, we conclude that there is no statistically significant difference, indicating that the policy change may not have affected program payments substantially.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This statistical test helps in understanding the financial implications of healthcare policy changes and assists in data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Form Hypotheses:**\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean values before and after the policy change.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean values before and after the policy change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Collect data:**\n",
    "I need to use an additional file to concatenate with the original dataset, which contains data from 2016 to 2021, while the extra file includes data from 2015. The dataset paths are specific to my local machine, so feel free to modify them according to your setup. Since the workbook contains multiple worksheets, we must also specify the exact worksheet we are working with."

It compares the mean total discharges across the entire pre-policy period (2015–2018) and the post-policy period (2019–2021).

    "1. **Anomalies or Outliers:** The sharp decline in discharges in 2020 could be due to extraordinary external factors, like the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused significant disruptions in hospital operations. This kind of event could drastically affect discharges in a single year, making it an outlier.\n",

    "2. **Yearly Variation:** The T-test examines overall trends and does not isolate yearly fluctuations. Even if 2020 is an outlier, its effect might not be significant enough to alter the overall results, as it is just one year within a larger multi-year comparison.\n",

# Medicare-Inpatient-Hospital
This repository contains code and tools for analyzing healthcare data, building interactive dashboards, and performing statistical analysis. The project focuses on Medicare inpatient hospital data and its implications on program utilization, payments, and healthcare policies. Key components of the project include:

## 1. Dashboards: 

Interactive visualizations built with Plotly and Dash to display healthcare trends and comparisons across hospital types, regions, and time periods. The dashboards provide insights into utilization patterns, program payments, cost-sharing variations, and demographic disparities in Medicare inpatient hospital data.

### Key Dashboards:
- üìä Utilization & Access Analysis (dashboard1.py)

  - Tracks hospital admissions trends over time.

  - Compares inpatient hospital utilization across geographic regions.

  - Analyzes disparities in hospital utilization based on demographic factors (age, race, gender).

  - Identifies the most frequently utilized hospital types.
    
- üí∞ Finance & Equity Analysis (dashboard2.py)

  - Visualizes changes in program payments for inpatient care over the years.

  - Examines the average cost per hospital stay for different demographic groups.

  - Compares cost-sharing amounts (out-of-pocket costs) across patient categories.

  - Highlights geographic and hospital-type differences in Medicare spending.
  
  - Evaluates disparities in healthcare costs among different population groups.

- üè• Hospital Performance & Policy Insights (dashboard3.py)

  - Ranks hospitals based on program payments and efficiency metrics.

  - Assesses how hospital size, type, and affiliation impact patient costs and care quality.

  - Tracks the effects of Medicare policy changes on utilization and costs.

  - Identifies regions and hospitals that could benefit from cost efficiency and equity interventions.

2. Statistical Analysis: Performing statistical tests, including T-tests, to understand significant differences in hospital performance, payment distribution, and the impacts of policy changes.

3. Predictive Modeling: Development of models to predict hospital efficiency by identifying high-efficiency hospitals based on program payments relative to utilization (i.e., cost per discharge or per day of care). Variables considered include program payments, hospital type, discharges, days of care, hospital size, and region.

The project provides insights into how healthcare policies and interventions affect Medicare utilization and payments, with an emphasis on visual representation for better decision-making.

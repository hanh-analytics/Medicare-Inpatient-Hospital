# Medicare-Inpatient-Hospital
This repository contains code and tools for analyzing healthcare data, building interactive dashboards, and performing statistical analysis. The project focuses on Medicare inpatient hospital data and its implications on program utilization, payments, and healthcare policies. Key components of the project include:

1. Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of Medicare inpatient data, including calculating program payments, discharges, and healthcare utilization.

2. Dashboards: Interactive visualizations built with Plotly and Dash to display healthcare trends and comparisons across hospital types, regions, and time periods.

3. Statistical Analysis: Performing statistical tests, including T-tests, to understand significant differences in hospital performance, payment distribution, and the impacts of policy changes.

4. Predictive Modeling: Development of models to predict hospital efficiency by identifying high-efficiency hospitals based on program payments relative to utilization (i.e., cost per discharge or per day of care). Variables considered include program payments, hospital type, discharges, days of care, hospital size, and region.

The project provides insights into how healthcare policies and interventions affect Medicare utilization and payments, with an emphasis on visual representation for better decision-making.
